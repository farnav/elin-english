### Grammar <a name="grammar"></a>

> **Useful information**

**There was/there were**

**There is / there are** can be used in any tense simply by changing the form of **be**, thus the past is **there was / there were**.

_We use **there was / there** **were** to say that somebody or something existed in a certain place in the past.
We use **there was + a** singular noun or **there were** + plural noun.
If the list of things begins with a singular noun, we use **there was**: There was a photo, two books and a remote control on the table.
If the list of things begins with a plural noun, we use **there were**: There were some plants, a fireplace and a sofa in the living room._



**A/an, some/any**
*Use* *a/an, some/any* *before the nouns!*
*Use a/an with a singular noun:* *There was a key on the table.*
*Use some/any (= not an exact number) with plural nouns. Use* **some** *in positive sentences and* **any** *in negative ones and questions:*
