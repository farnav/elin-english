### Grammar <a name="grammar"></a> 

Для начала вспомним, что для единственного числа добавляем артикль **a/an**: a carpet, an orange.

Множественное формируем, убрав артикль и добавив к слову суффикс **s**: a bottle -> bottles



**-es** прибавляется к существительным, которые оканчиваются на **-sh, -ch, -s, -z, и -x**:

> Box -> boxes
> Beach -> beaches
> Waltz -> waltzes



Существительные, оканчивающиеся **на согласный + y**, типа lady, candy, family, city, в множественном числе отбрасывают y и присваивают окончание **ies**:

> Memory -> memories 



**Но если гласный, ничего не меняем**:
Donkey -> donkeys
**Примечание**: это правило не распространяется на имена собственные.

> The Kennedy family = the Kennedys 



**Неправильные существительные**

- man – men
- woman – women
- child – children
- person – people
- tooth – teeth
- foot – feet
- goose – geese
- louse – lice
- mouse – mice
- ox – oxen



**Англичане и сами смеются над нелогичностью своего языка. Вот даже, какой стишок написали:**

> We'll begin with **box**, and the plural is **boxes**;
> But the plural of **ox** should be **oxen**, not oxes.
> You may find a lone **mouse** or a nest full of **mice**,
> Yet the plural of **house** is **houses**, not hice.
> If the plural of **man** is always called **men**,
> Why shouldn't the plural of **pan** be called **pen**?
> So our English, I think, you all will agree,
> Is the craziest language you ever did see.



Существительные, оканчивающиеся на – **o**:

- echo — echoes
- hero — heroes
- potato — potatoes
- tomato — tomatoes



А некоторые прибавляют только **s**:
- auto — autos
- kangaroo — kangaroos
- kilo — kilos
- memo — memos
- photo — photos
- piano — pianos
- radio — radios
- solo — solos
- soprano — sopranos
- studio — studios
- tattoo — tattoos
- video — videos
- zoo — zoos



Ну а какие-то существительные на – **о** вообще могут позволить себе и то, и другое, в зависимости от настроения. Но все же, более стандартным считается окончание – **es**:
- memento — mementoes, mementos
- mosquito — mosquitoes, mosquitos
- tornado — tornadoes, tornados
- volcano — volcanoes, volcanos
- zero — zeroes, zeros



Некоторые существительные, оканчивающиеся на **–f** или **–fe**, меняют окончание на **–ves**:
- life — lives
- wolf — wolves
- calf — calves
- half — halves
- knife — knives
- leaf — leaves
- shelf — shelves
- thief — thieves



А какие-то слова на **-f**, **-fe** просто добавляют **s**.
Например, слово «proof» множественное число образует стандартным путем: добавляя s. Берут с него пример и эти слова:
- belief — beliefs
- chief — chiefs
- cliff — cliffs
- roof — roofs



Формы множественного числа, совпадающие с формами единственного:
- deer — олень, олени
- fish — рыба, рыбы
- salmon — лосось, сёмга
