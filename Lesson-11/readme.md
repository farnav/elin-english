**18 Kissing Customs From Around the World.**

Have you ever experienced that **awkward** moment when you meet someone new and you reach out to **shake their hand** and get pulled in for a cheek-to-cheek air kiss? Will it be a one-cheek kiss, both cheeks, once, twice, how many times? Ladies, how often has a man kissed your hand when introduced? Did you ever kiss a frog in the hopes it’d turn into a handsome prince?

There are so many kissing **customs** from around the world, not to **mention** the many **fairy tales** we learn as children. As it’s Valentine’s Day Eve, I thought today would be a great day to explore some of these kissing customs. Just **in case** you’re planning a romantic getaway this weekend, this will help prepare you for any unexpected **smooches**.

1. Instead of kissing on the lips, Eskimos, Polynesians and Malaysians **rub** noses.
2. In some countries, men will kiss a woman’s hand when saying hello or goodbye.
3. Victorian etiquette required a man to kiss the back of a lady’s hand.
4. African **tribes** show respect to their Chief by kissing the ground where he has walked.
5. In Ireland, it is believed that you will have good luck if you kiss the Blarney Stone.
6. It is **illegal** in Indiana for a man with a mustache to “habitually kiss human beings.” (Really?)
7. In Hartford, Connecticut it’s illegal for a husband to kiss his wife on Sunday.
8. In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, it’s a crime to kiss a stranger.
9. The air-kiss, or cheek-kiss, is most commonly found in Europe.
10. People often associate the French kiss with France due to their flirty nature.
11. In Spain, people always air-kiss twice, starting with the right cheek. Men, on the other hand, always shake hands instead.
12. The air-kiss is also popular in Italy (although, not North Italy), but starts on the left side, and only when happens among those who know each other.
13. In Germany, people tend to avoid kissing altogether. Germans prefer to shake hands if they don’t know each other, or **hug** if they’re friends.
14. In Belgium, people just give each other the one ‘air kiss’ – yep men too! – but they don’t shake hands in social setting, only in business matters, because it is considered too formal.
15. In the US, the men tend to shake hands while women usually **greet** with a kiss on one or both cheeks, along with a hug.
16. In South Africa, men will kiss women they know on the cheek, but just shake hands with strangers.
17. Greeting with a kiss is somewhat new in Japan and China, as kissing was only every considered necessary during romantic moments, and was not to be done in public.
18. Kissing in public in India is most definitely **frowned upon**.
