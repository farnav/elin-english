### Reading <a name="reading"></a>

**1. Do you do housework at home?**
Yes, I do! I prefer to do it on my own. I live by myself in a small, studio apartment so it’s easy enough. Actually, I find housework to be relaxing. When I feel stressed, I like the **mindless activity** of scrubbing the shower, floors, and kitchen cabinets. I really hate sweeping though! I always miss too many spots.

**2. What kinds of housework do you often do?**
All of them! I do dishes, dusting, sweeping, mopping, and scrubbing the kitchen and bathroom. I usually do a deep clean every two weeks, but keep tidying up during the week. I have a **pet peeve** of having a clean bathroom, so I generally do that about once a week.

**3. Did you do housework when you were a child?**
Yes, my parents enforced this. They had a rotation chore assignment chart for the 4 of us children every week. We would earn $5 a week for completing them. If we **acted up****, extra chores would be **put on** us. If we had a special accomplishment, like straight A’s, we would be off chores for a week.

**4. Do you think that children should do housework?**
Absolutely! Even if the parents could hire help instead, it teaches children a sense of responsibility and skill. Also, it helps them to not be **spoiled**. When they learn these skills at a young age, they can carry it into their adulthood and be better homemakers.

**5. Do you think that men and women should share housework?**
Without a doubt! I don’t believe in these gender stereotypes of only women doing housework. I believe it is the responsibility of both people. Moreover, when they share the responsibilities, it takes the pressure off both of them. However, if one spouse is working all day and the other is at home, I think the one at home should cover the housework.

**6. What kinds of household chores do you dislike doing?**
I despise sweeping! Ever since I was a child, I’ve had a **poor eye** for the dirt on the floor. I always tend to miss spots, then later when I mop, it makes a mess! Actually, at my first job in a restaurant, I was banned from sweeping because I did such a poor job!
