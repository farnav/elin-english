**Describe a photo that you like most using the example above.** 

> It was winter 2017. I was standing in front of the maternity hospital. The weather was snowy and very cold. I felt a bit unusual. It wasn't my first child so those feelings were familiar to me. I smoked one cigarette after another worrying about my wife's health. Suddenly I was called from the window. The doctor allowed me to visit my wife. I came into the building and there was a visit room, I was waiting there. My wife appeared at the door holding our daughter. I took my daughter very carefully and start staring at her for the first time. The feelings were amazing. At that moment my wife took a photo from my back. If you look at the photo you will see my daughter sleeping and me trying to wake her up but she didn't want to. Only God knows if I will have a moment like again.
